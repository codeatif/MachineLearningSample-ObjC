# MachineLearningSample-ObjC
A simple iOS app to demonstrate Machine Learning capabilities using Core ML and Vision framework.


Requirements:

iOS 11 for all features
Xcode 9

Usage:

Run the app and select an image from gallery or camera. App uses Inceptionv3.mlmodel (https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/coreml/models/Inceptionv3.mlmodel)
to process image. Vision framework allows quick face recognition.

Screenshots:

As you can see the model is not exactly 100% correct and still has miles to cover!
